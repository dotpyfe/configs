" KCH vimrc 2011

" I'm using Vim 7.3, I did notice problems with 7.0
" Note: As far as I know, this will only work on Unix
" current list of Vim extensions I'm using:
"
" 	Pathogen: easy modular management of plugins
" 	Tagbar: Taglist++, source code browsing (requires exuberant-ctags pkg
	" 	>=v5.5) (currently mapped to <leader>1)
" 	SuperTab: Insert-mode tab completion
" 	Surround: easy mappings for parens, brackets, quotes, etc (e.g. cs'" to
	" 	change single quotes to double quotes
" 	NERDTree: better file explorer, i.e. replaces :Ex and :Vex (mapped to
	"	<leader>2)
" 	NERDCommenter: easy mappings for inserting comments ('<leader>cc' etc in cmd mode to use)
" 	CloseTag: auto-tag closing for HTML/XML
" 	DlimitMate: autocomplete for quotes, parens, brackets, etc.
" 	Fugitive: git integration (e.g. :Gstatus)
" 	Argtextobj: allows function arguments to be edited as vim text objects
" 	Indenttextobj: allows text at same indent level to be edited as vim text
	" 	objects (particularly useful for, e.g., Python)
" 	Grepvim: grep integration (use :Grep, among other things)
" 	Bufexplorer: easy buffer navigation (just use <leader>be)
" 	FuzzyFinder: search files, buffers, tags etc. (e.g. <leader>ff)
	"	-> L9lib: required for FuF
"   Avim: quickly change between source and header files (:A, :AS, :AV) doesn't
	"   seem to be able to find h files in different dirs though
"   AutoloadCscope: forces Cscope to recurse up parent dirs to find the
	"   database (build db with cscope -R -b, add -q to build inverted index for
	"   quicker lookups, add -k when doing kernel/lib hacking to tell cscope to
	"   ignore /usr/include)
"	SnipMate: great for auto-completion of common tags,func templates etc
"

" Use :help <plugin-name> to find out more
